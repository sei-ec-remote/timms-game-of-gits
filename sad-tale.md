House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark had a cool coat.

Just kidding, Ned's life sucked because it was cut short(har har) by the royal executioner.
